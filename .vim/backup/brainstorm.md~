### style/objective of the old, polish + computing power of the new

## length
* SHORT and CAN BE WON
* replayed for better score, time, ending

## levels
* few separate levels(e.g. donkey kong, ms. pac-man, nimble quest)
* separate rooms (e.g. pitfall!, adventure)
  * every room is a checkpoint (can still break the game (unwinnable) though)
* 2 tiers of physical (top acrobatic / bottom combat-ish)
* edge-portals (e.g. adventure/pitfall!, pac-man/!!TRON!!)
* reinclusive edges (e.g. asteroids)

## gameplay
* 2 tiers of playfield (galaxian carriers and dropships)
* different speed = new strategy (e.g. missile command, tron, space invaders)
* different ratio of mobs = more intense (e.g. galaxian)
* slow (e.g. tron)

## item
* tron - disc takes time to come back to you
* sparse, immediately visible, OPTIONAL item (e.g. mario hammer, pac-man eats)

## mobs
* central enemy hive (e.g. pac-man)
* descending (e.g. galaxian, space invaders, atlantis, missile command)

## health
* can win back lives (e.g. tron)
* instant, intuitive gauge (e.g. tron, missile command)
* 2 tiers of health (e.g. missle command)
* no penalty for hitting other actors (e.g. tron, galaxian)
* dying makes you stronger, lamer (e.g. Jap fighting game)

## controls
* solar fox - speed boost is only control
* asteroids - too mathy?
* atlantis - no movement, all timing
* donkey kong - left/right + action is nice amount of controls
* drag-the-snake-like 
* down - random teleport

## art
* 2600-era graphics is the only viable way to stand out
* rad and dynamic bg (i.e. atlantas)
* foley sound effects or uber-synth? (e.g. donkey kong, pac-man)
* old game cover art
* fuck copy; wordplay

## UI
* arcade game landing screen (art + title + press start)
* zero menu (PAUSE)
* choose levels by swiping horizontal, difficulty swiping vertically
* endgame
  * galaxian - triple-branding + psychedelic flashes
  * tron - see the game continue playing
  * donkey kong - pause endgame
  * hexagon - scores and insta-repeat

## miscellaneous
* immediate goal sign (peach+dk refrain at finish line)
